# Bright Image Color Correction
When adding art to your stream be careful about adding "bright" images. For some devices (i.e. mobile) it can make it far brighter than someone may be comfortable with being so close to a screen.

You can add an image filter to this to make it appear similarly but provide far less impact on the eyes.

Below are examples for OBS
- [OBS](#obs)
- [Streamlabs OBS](#streamlabs-obs)

## OBS

1. Right click your image source and select `Filters`

3. Use the `Opacity` slider to reduce the image brightness. I recommend somewhere between 0.3 and 0.7 depending on how bright the image is
